Of course! I apologize for that YAML syntax error. The error message from Codemagic is very clear:

**`expected <block end>, but found '<scalar>'`**

This is a classic YAML indentation problem. The `args` section for the static analysis step was incorrectly structured as a sibling to `script`, when the arguments should have been part of the `script` command itself.

I have corrected this syntax error and also made the iOS build script slightly more robust by adding the `xcode-project use-profiles` command, which is a best practice for applying the correct provisioning profiles.

Here is the full, corrected `codemagic.yaml` file.

### Corrected `codemagic.yaml`

Save this code in the root of your repository. It will resolve the configuration error.

```yaml
# codemagic.yaml
# Reference: https://docs.codemagic.io/yaml-basic-configuration/

workflows:

          flutter analyze . --no-fatal-infos --no-fatal-warnings
        # Ignore failures for now, but it's good practice to enforce this.

### Summary of Changes

1.  **Fixed Static Analysis Script:**
    *   **Removed:** The separate `args:` block which was causing the YAML parsing error.
    *   **Modified:** The `script` for `Run static analysis` now includes the arguments directly on the command line:
        ```yaml
        script: |
          flutter analyze . --no-fatal-infos --no-fatal-warnings
        ```
2.  **Improved iOS Script:**
    *   Added `xcode-project use-profiles` right after adding the provisioning profile. This command ensures that Xcode uses the profile you just installed, which prevents many common code-signing issues.

Now, you can commit this updated `codemagic.yaml` to your repository, and Codemagic will be able to parse it correctly and run your build.
